Ensure that the file path callout to the generatMarkdown file from the index.js file is correct, this is found on line 4 of the index.js file.

  This application is initiated by running node index.js in the integrated terminal window.  Following this step, the user simply follows prompts and inputs their responses until the final prompt has been answered.  The ReadMe will automatically generate from here.
